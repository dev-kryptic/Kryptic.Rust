# Contributing

This repository is the Rust daemon client for Kryptic (`kryptic-daemon-client`).

## What we accept

- Bug fixes and test coverage
- Documentation corrections
- Compatibility fixes

## What we do not accept

- Storing or logging secret values in plaintext
- Breaking changes to the daemon IPC protocol without a coordinated Daemon release

- Public GitHub issues for vulnerabilities (email security@kryptic.dev)

## Development

```bash
cargo test
```

Protocol details: [Kryptic.Daemon/PROTOCOL.md](https://github.com/dev-kryptic/Kryptic.Daemon/blob/main/PROTOCOL.md).

## Releasing

A merge to `main` is the release. The publish workflow commits the version bump as
the Kryptic Release Bot, publishes to crates.io, tags `vX.Y.Z`, and opens a
GitHub Release using the matching section in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).

Before merging release-worthy changes, move notes from **Unreleased** into a
`## X.Y.Z` section so the release has a description.
